#The what, when and why of roboshell

= Introduction =

After using many shells we came to the realisation than the world was still in need of a modern software development construct for rapid creation of robust, PC-based applications.

Existing programs just didn't do what I wanted them to do neatly. I needed to be able to develop several user interfaces in such a way that they would be easy to extend and quick to implement. I donn't like comprimising polish or functionality and I wanted the long-term groundwork put into each to be available to the next in a structured, repeatable way.

Above all, I wanted a Shell that enabled my thinking and facilitated innovation, rather than have me re-using features from previous programs and risk comprimising current projects for the sake of re-using code.  I like things clean, but I don't like to do everything from the ground-up to achieve it.
